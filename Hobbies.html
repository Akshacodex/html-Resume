    I have a diverse range of interests when it comes to entertainment. I enjoy immersing myself in the world of light novels, finding delight in their captivating stories. Music is another passion of mine, and I take great pleasure in exploring various genres from around the globe. Whether it's the catchy tunes of Japan and Korea, the melodies of America and France, or the soulful rhythms of Tamil music, each holds a special place in my heart. If I had to pick just one genre to enjoy for the rest of my life, without a doubt, it would be Tamil music. Its richness and depth never fail to resonate with me on a profound level.
