<h1>Hobbies</h1>

<p>I like to read light novels and listen to music. My music taste is really broad I listen music from countries in the west to east meaning I listen to songs from Japan, and Korea to songs from America and France. And especially love Tamil Music if I was told to choose one than I would choose Tamil music as the only genre I would ever listen to for the rest of my life.</p>
